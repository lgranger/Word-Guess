✅ Need to return list of already guessed letters
✅ Need to sanitize user input
✅ Add more words to random word array

Optional:
✅ Don't penalize for guessing the same letter more than once
✅ Add difficulty levels (harder levels have words with more letters)
✅ Allow the user to enter a whole word as input (of they think they know the answer)

Monday List:

  [?] if you win first and then loose you get both win and loose, not just loose
  [X] typing easy, medium, or hard brings up the "that wasn't on the list"
* make the guess into a separate class
* rename?
